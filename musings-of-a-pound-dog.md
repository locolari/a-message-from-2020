# Musings Of A Pound Dog

As I sit here and cry, I’m wondering why
My favourite person left me here to die
I was so happy when we went for a ride
I loved going with you when we went outside

But they’ve told me that you aren’t coming back
I’m here all alone without my pack
I’m scared and it’s cold, and where are my toys?
And why are the other dogs making so much noise.

My tail is drooping and my ears won’t stand up
I’m not interested in eating, I’m just a sad pup
People walk past me and I can’t lift my head
I’ve heard that soon I might end up dead

If no one will come and take me home
I’m going to have to die here alone.
So I’ll just sit and wait for my euthanize date
I don’t know what I did to deserve such a fate

But wait, what is this? Someone’s coming through.
My ears prick up slightly when they say, “I like you.”
Then this friendly human comes over to my bed
And sits down beside me and pats my head

My tail starts to move and it hits the ground with a slap
They keep talking to me, so I reply with a yap
They pick me up and take me outside
Will anyone want me after being left behind?
They said the word “foster”, and they’re really quite kind

I go home with them, and I’m scared at the start
But my foster family have a really nice heart
We laugh and we play, but they say I can’t stay, 
At least I’ve got them and I’m happy for today. 
I know they won’t leave me until I find love once more. 
So now I have hope for all the good things in store!
