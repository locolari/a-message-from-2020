# Curry, right?

The other day in the supermarket a man wanted to declare
His words of wisdom, so he said, curry, right?
It was such a surprise that all I could say was … yeah.
And maybe he had positive intentions, but I got the hell out of there.
 
Let me take that question completely out of context.
Just humour me, because I want to dig into what it is about this that screams curry.
 
I mean, to be fair I do look Sri Lankan or Indian or African or Aboriginal
Or something else that's not like you
I guess at least 50% of the time if you assumed that someone like me liked curry, that would be true.
 
I know more about Australian and white history than I do about the Singhalese.
And no, I don't have another native language at home
English is the only language I speak.
And when you pass me in the street, what I feel is relief because you didn't ask a stupid question or yell something demeaning at me.
But yes. I like curry.

Did you know I got all As in high school? And I like lasagne too.
And when I finished my uni, I actually got the top mark in my degree. The deans medal was awarded to me. But yes, I like curry.
 
When the kids called me a poo in school, because for some reason that was cool,
I didn’t say anything until one day I’d had enough and I retaliated with, “Yeah? Well you’re sour cream.”
And then they ran screaming to the teacher because I’d hurt their fragile self-esteem.
And the teacher thought it seemed fair to punish me for this atrocity.
And yes, I still like curry.
 
The funny thing is, I wasn’t born liking curry. But I was told that I had curry in my genes,
What does that even mean? Well, I guess I just have to resign myself to the fact that when I go to the canteen my plight
Is to have someone tell me, “Curry, right?”
 
 
I’m not really black, black, but I’m definitely not white. If you blacks can take me in, I’d rather side with you.
Well, actually that’s not entirely true because from my point of view, I am the same as you and we are the same as every other white person too.
So, why should we even be taking sides or having to hide when the only differences come down to something as simple as curry, right?
 
But, if the only difference between you and me is my choice of cuisine and perhaps what you see,
On the outside? That’s not so bad, is it? I mean, do we really have to fight over black and white?
Why does humanity have to spend time dividing each other over something as simple as,
Curry, right?
