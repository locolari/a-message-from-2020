# Life Story

I met a little girl the other day
And she had some interesting things to say.
When she was born
Her parents gave her away
She was sent to Australia
To start over again
She thought she had escaped the pain
But then her new father to his shame
Got into the gambling game.
He found other women
He used his poor wife
He yelled and he cursed
He made everything worse.
And when she was nine he tried to take his own life
And she was the one who found him in time.
With eyes on the ground
She said to me she grew up with such insecurity.
See, she even came under scrutiny
And was teased for her colour mercilessly.
She went through depression
And battled in silence
She wished her father would resort to violence
Because then somebody would notice
But nobody asked the question
Are you okay, because
She was smiling every day.
But every night, she was crying
Desperately trying
To find a place to fit in.
Just somewhere to belong.
Something to hold on to
Some way to be strong.
And when that girl was sixteen
Her mother died of cancer
For her, there were no answers
And still, that girl went on
Wondering, why things were going so wrong?
But then that girl she had a dream
Instead of wondering what might have been
Writing words became her vaccine
That girl doesnâ€™t want any sympathy
She only wants to share her story
So that all the world can see that
All those things made that girl
Into me.
