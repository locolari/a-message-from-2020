# Love Yourself

Can we stop this pattern of self deprecation, self hate
It’s going around far too much amongst us all of late.
I must admit I myself am a contender
I’ll tell you now that I have been a repeat offender
This inner disgust when I look at myself
Valuing the superficial over my health
The need to trim and pluck and cover all of my flaws
The things that make me me I keep locked behind doors.
Thinking if I lose weight I’ll feel better for sure
But I’ve heard it from a model that they’re most insecure.
 
I’ve hated the fact that I’ve got dark skin
And when it’s night-time all you can see is my grin
But something I’ve learned and I know it is true
Is the ones who really matter will love you for you
It shouldn’t matter whether you’re large or you’re thin
The most important things all come from within
 
Sometimes I don’t go out and be the best that I can be
Because instead I’m in my head thinking of how you see me.
What if I look stupid? What if my teeth aren’t white?
What if my face is weird? What if my clothes don’t fit right?
Why can’t I look perfect like the person on my screen?
If I could be like that, I’d have better self-esteem.
But maybe if we focused on the things we are and can do
We’ll realize that reality is only what we make true
 
Some of us are good with words, some are good with tools
Some of us are clever and some love being fools
We are who we are and the earth needs every one
Cos if we’re all the same, how would things get done?
So please don’t try to fit yourself into a little square
If someone doesn’t like you, that’s no reason to despair
Can you call someone a friend if they don’t know the real you?
If they won’t defend your choices, if they want to change you? 
 
Don’t let your happiness belong to other people
Don’t be ashamed or change yourself just to be an equal.
Why should our differences cause us any shame?
Each one of us is beautiful because we’re not the same
Our imperfections are the things that make us who we are
Every little freckle and birthmark and scar
It doesn’t make sense when we’re all individuals
To compare ourselves between ourselves and sit around miserable
 
 
So let yourself be you, and let me be me
Ignore the ones who hold you back and one day they’ll see
That you chased your own dreams, pursued all your goals
Lived so you had no regrets when you got old
You only get one life, so don’t walk it in a straight line
Do the things that scare you, and let the real you shine.
 
Your body is yours, so take the control
Speak out and tell your story, don’t be the untold.
Your heart is yours to give so love who you want to
Your life is yours to live, so let your true self come through
So many different souls on earth, so why should I be
Anyone or anything other than me?
