# Mother, Mum

I need your love
To help me be strong,
How else will I manage
To keep going on?
They admire me:
Smart, hardworking, they say,
But what do they know?
They’re wrong anyway.
It always was you
Every year, every day,
You were the one
Who showed me the way.
I knew I was safe
When you held me, I cried,
But now I look back,
What you covered, I hide.
The truth, then concealed,
The lies and the pain,
But you taught me true joy
Is not solely in gain.
It’s the simplest things:
A walk, game, or ride,
Or just having somebody
There by your side.
Somebody who cares,
Who does understand,
Who knows the right moment
To hold onto your hand.
I am so afraid
Now that you’re not here,
But I don’t know why,
What is it I fear?
Is it that I’m alone
With nobody to care?
Nobody to run to,
Nobody to share
All those little things,
The meaning of life,
Anything, everything,
From heartache to strife.
Is it not having someone
To listen and hold,
Who would always accept me
Whether young, fat, bald, old?
Whether stupid or wise,
Pretty or not,
Annoying, too crazy,
You never forgot
Who I was, who I am
Who I wanted to be;
Always, forever,
You loved me for me.
So here’s to our future,
Our past, and the now.
To them, you’re not here,
But you’re with me somehow.
So always, forever,
Don’t let me forget
To remember the good times
Without having regret.
I know that you know,
I know that you knew,
Forever and always,
Mother, Mum, I love you.
