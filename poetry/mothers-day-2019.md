# Mother’s Day 2019

I woke up thinking about you this morning.
But that’s not unusual. I often do.
It’s just that today in particular, I would have liked to get you a gift. 
I saw the display in the supermarket and wished
I could buy you a stupid mug or a fancy card.
I know it’s a waste of money, but it’s really hard
To keep walking past them, when all I want to do is say.
How much I love you this mother’s day.
I tried to ignore all the cheap gifts on the shelf,
I tried to shrug off the way I felt.
But, I couldn’t help giving them a second glance
And wishing that I had the chance
To buy some silly thing that would make you smile
To tell you how much I care and just be together for a while.

I did take a moment to read the cards and I knew
Which one I would have picked out just for you.
But if I had the time, I probably would have made one
And it would have said you’re the world’s best mum.
I would have written thank you for being someone I can look up to
Thank you, mum, for being you. 
I’m really thankful that you chose me.
And for everything you did to make me happy.
Thank you for the nights you tucked me in.
Thank you for making me feel beautiful in my skin.
Thank you for being there through my ups and downs.
And for being someone I could trust and depend on. 
Thank you for loving me at my best and my worst.
And thank you for always putting me first. 
So, here’s to the sweetest, kindest mother and my dearest friend,
You were the greatest gift anyone could send.

Today isn’t the only day that I miss you, but this is one day I find particularly difficult
It’s bittersweet really, because I see everyone else so happy and then I feel guilt
For feeling sorry for myself because I miss you a lot.
But I know you wouldn’t want me to think sad thoughts.
So, instead of feeling left out, I’ll try remember all the good times we had.
But please forgive me if my smile seems a bit sad,
Because deep down I feel the pain
Of losing you, and if I could change just one thing
It would be to have you back again.
But I’ll just have to settle with fond memories and the love I’ll forever hold in my heart.
Because life isn’t fair and it tore us apart. 
Just know that I would give anything for you to stay. 
So I could make you breakfast and give you the world with a card saying
Happy Mother’s Day.
