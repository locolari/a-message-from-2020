# My First Spoken Word Poem
 
I am no speaker. Right now I’m petrified because I am an introvert
Behind the scenes is where I shine, but today I want to assert
myself, and share my story. In 92 I was born, across the seas, a blank
slate, perhaps with predisposed personality traits, low in rank.
At eight weeks old I was given up, I don’t know why they didn’t want me.
But I was blessed with adoption, new parents, from a foreign country,
Australia, a land of new Beginnings. Life was looking good
I started out filled with hopes and dreams just like every child should.
When I was three, I went to childcare. I discovered prejudice that year,
When another little girl said to me, ‘You shouldn’t be here’.
Next came school, and kids were cruel. Because of my skin colour, I was
different, and different was bad. The emotional pain may have been the cause
of my inner retreat, away from the names and the teacher who believed
that because of my colour my goals in English could never be achieved.
I tried my best to mask the outward flaws that condemned me to be inferior,
Always wondering why they couldn’t see I am more than my exterior.
I have learned that no matter what you do, people will see what they want to
Even though I try to tell them that, inside I am the same as you.
My father was kind to everyone except my mother and I.
Emotional abuse left no scars outside, but inside I wanted to die.
I have learned that depression is not weakness, that it takes strength to go on
When the future seems empty and dark and you can’t find a place to belong.
Cancer took my mother when I was 16 and part of me died that day
there was nothing in the world that could take the emotional pain away.
I have learned that grief does not heal with time, but like a tidal wave, it overtakes
You, each surge of memory breaking your heart just a little bit more in its wake.
But even tsunamis have an end, so I ride every wave as it comes
Knowing that this too shall pass and I can rest while waiting for the next one.
I have learned that the most beautiful things can come from the depths of despair
Stories of strength, love, and survival. These stories were meant to be shared.
Afraid, I displayed my creations from behind a screen. In anonymity
I wrote my poetry and envied those who had the ability
To share their conceptions through spoken word to stand up here and be heard
To put their name to their verse, unashamed and leave the audience stirred.
So, no, I am not a speaker, but today I have made a start
For today I am standing before you and speaking these words from my heart.
