# The Life of An Ant
 
It always makes me wonder inside
As I watch the fragile ants,
So busy each day
Gathering for themselves.
What do they think when they climb the trees?
Do they see the big picture,
Or just bark, bark, bark,
More bark and then the leaves.
 
Do they ponder the meaning of life,
Or do they simply exist?
They all seem so sure
Of what they are doing.
Have they considered the universe?
Their place and purpose on earth?
Or is it enough
Just to live for themselves.
 
Do they realise when I am nearby
How easily I could end them?
But I tread careful
For we are all the same.
What is out there in the great unknown?
Things I cannot comprehend.
With my eyes I see
So much, and yet, nothing.
 
When I behold the endless blackness
Dotted with millions of stars,
I think to myself,
I am merely an ant.
What unseen beings are looking down,
Laughing at my frailty?
I know so much, yet
I cannot comprehend
The great vastness of the universe.
I suppose I will know soon
And understand it.
But for now I just live,
I follow the rules, the rigid lines,
Laid out by society.
I wear my blinders
So I can plod along
And ask myself, will it be enough?
When my end finally comes,
Will I be happy
Having been just an ant?
