# These Hands
 
These hands are free, they belong to me
But these hands could easily be
beggar’s hands out in the street,
pleading with each hand they meet
To throw a dollar at their feet.
These hands are free, but regrettably,
There are some hands across the seas who are slaves to giant companies.
Fingers working desperately, though treated with contempt
By narrow-minded greedy hands grasping at the top one percent.
These hands could be a child’s hands, calloused, struggling through the day
Working hard to meet demands in a nation far away
Where other children’s hands just play.
These hands could be indigenous hands,
The first ones in these mighty southern sands
Think about how we would feel if our hands were bound
By settlers from another place who took possession of our ground.
With cold and callous fists burnt our communities down
And took our values and beliefs and turned it all around.
So let’s hold out hands of harmony and listen to them respectfully
With these hands of ours so free, let’s have a little empathy for our Indigenous community
And respect their truths about history
When we glimpse the helpless hands reaching forth across the seas
Who are we to raise our hands and languish in ascendency?
To deny all those precious hands a foundation in this expansive nation?
To accept the amputation of hands who plead in desperation?
These hands are free and gratefully I will remember them
Whose hands were spent for liberty, though they were young men
And women too, the brave who gave tremendously, before the grave. 
Hands lost for our autonomy
So with our precious freedom, let’s take responsibility
And value the hands, native to our sands,
And welcome the hands who have need of our lands.
Remember the hands who took a stand and fought for our democracy
Let’s learn from their comradery. 
And stand for worldwide equality. Because we're all brothers and sisters globally.
And I could have been you and you could have been me.
These hands should all receive the same, yet some hands are dealt loss and pain.
Do those hands really deserve the blame for all the things that fate has dealt?
When with these hands we could have helped?
So let’s lend our hands to everyone because ours have been the lucky ones.
