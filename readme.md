# This is a snapshot of the world through my eyes in 2020. 

The world is very connected now with the internet, the thing that we all rely on. Most people are looking at their phones more than they're looking around them. Everyone loves to use social media, with platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube being the most popular. 

Technology has increased at a huge pace since I was born. I'm 28 years old now. But I remember when we used floppy discs, CD-ROMS, and then USB drives, and now most of us upload things to the cloud. I was born before Google and YouTube existed. But now you can find the answers to basically anything on Google. 

Healthwise, I'd say we're doing pretty good. People live longer in general due to healthcare. There's been a scare this year with the coronavirus, which is a form of flu that came from live animal markets in China. It seems like lots of these global diseases came from animals. They've shut down Wuhan, an area of China. But people travel so often these days that it's really hard to stop such a virus from spreading. 

We have it pretty good where I live in Australia. Most people have pretty much everything they need. We've had our fair share of natural disasters recently though, with massive bushfires that threaten to wipe out some of our native species. Huge number of animals have died, including half of our koala population, which is one of our iconic species. Do koalas still exist in 3020? I hope so. 

I thought it would be fun to write down some of my predictions for the future. Some of these things probably already exist on a small scale because tech is improving so fast that I can't keep up. 

Driverless cars are already a thing. I've never been in one. The thought scares me, putting my life in the hands of a car. We still drive a petrol four wheel drive with a rooftop tent so we can go camping. But I think all cars will be electric or solar powered in the future. 

They're talking about people living on the moon or Mars soon. Maybe even in my lifetime. I think it'll happen. Unfortunately, I think humans will find it easier to abandon earth, rather than try to save it. It's a pity because we already have this planet with everything we need. If we move to other planets then we have to make them habitable for us. And what will happen to the animals? Which species will make it to the other planets? 

My guess is that dogs and cats will make it. I also think we'll take horses because they've been an integral part of our advancements through history as humans. Probably rats and mice will get there because their DNA is so similar to ours and I assume scientists will still want to study the poor things. 

My guess is that flies and mosquitoes won't come. They're probably important for our ecosystem, but they're so annoying. Nobody in their right mind would take them. Hopefully they take the bees though, unless they find a new way to grow plants without bees. I also can't imagine life without honey. 

I have to say, there's a chance that humanity doesn't even survive if we don't learn to get along. But I think that chance is very small because there's some very rich people who have contingency survival plans. When things go bad, it's always those with less money who suffer. 

The political environment in the world is very precarious right now. I'd say we're on the brink of going either way. We've come so far with human rights, but there are some leaders who seem intent on taking those right away from certain groups of people. They say we’re at a tipping point with climate change, which means that if we keep going the way we are, then we won’t be able to undo the damage we’ve done to the earth’s climate. Temperatures are rising globally, but still we argue between us about if climate change is a thing and who should be doing what about it, and even who is responsible for it. 

Certain countries and groups of people seem way too focused on their own economies and ways of living instead of caring about the overall global health of our earth and species and all the other species we rely on. Rich countries blame poor countries and poor countries blame rich countries. Voters blame their leaders, and leaders say they’re doing what the voters wanted. Individuals blame companies, and companies point the finger at their customers who are still buying their products anyway. 

I have been travelling for the last two years and have seen the effort those in poorer countries have been making to reduce their use of plastic and to reuse all of it. Richer countries often sit back and point fingers and say that it doesn't matter what they do because it doesn't make a difference anyway, and some world leaders deny that climate change even exists. I guess by 3020 you'll have some idea about who was right or wrong in that debate.

There seems to be a big difference between the generations right now too, with the older generations being more likely to be happy with how things are going and less likely to care about the earth (but there are some who do). The youth are trying to speak out in whatever way they can. Many who aren't even old enough to vote take to the streets regularly, particularly on Fridays which have been termed Fridays For Future. They strike to demand more climate action and climate justice from their leaders. Because when bad weather events happen, it seems to be the poorest who are affected the most and the worst. 

I hope that in the future there will be no countries and no borders. I hope humanity will have learned to accept each other and share with each other and work together. I hope that people won't be building their wealth and success off the backs of other people suffering. I hope that humans have learned the value of our earth and all the species in it, and that we have worked together to protect all life that has not yet gone extinct. I hope the earth still has beautiful coral reefs and colorful fish and birds, bears and lions and penguins and turtles and all of the other amazing animal life that makes earth such an interesting place. I hope the connection between humanity and other species is strong.

I believe that gene/DNA selection will be a thing, where parents can select the traits of their children. I hope this does not lead to a world that is more superficial than it already is. I hope we can learn to value each other and ourselves further than what's on the surface, because we are all much more than our looks. In fact, we can learn from individuals that we label as not normal. I think humanity has a lot to gain from those who think outside the box and those who are different from the majority of us. 

I wonder if they'll have found a way to upload brains to the internet so people can go on existing online after they die. That's a weird one. I don't think I'd want to be part of that. I also wonder if they’ll have found a way to wake up those who have frozen themselves to be reawakened in the future.  

It is possible that humanity gets taken over by the very tech we built to support us. If that happens, I'm not sure whether we deserve it or not. We certainly should have seen it coming. And I'm not sure whether tech being in control will lead to a better and more equal world or a worse one. We'll have to wait and see if that happens. 

It is inevitable that we end up with too many humans for this planet to support. I wonder how we deal with that in the future. I guess there will be wars over resources, as there always has been. I hope we find a way to solve things together instead of fighting. I hope instead of needless killing that people choose to have less or no children for the sake of our planet and letting it breathe. 

I hope music still exists. I write poems for a hobby and to express how I feel. I have included some of my poems in a poetry folder in this repository.
